Computer Graphics Project 
Spider-Man: Shadows Over the City
**Project Description**
This project is a simple 3D Spider-Man game made using C++ and OpenGL (GLUT). The main goal of this project is to learn basic computer graphics by creating a small game. In this game, the player controls a Spider-Man character inside a virtual city. The city includes buildings, a sky with stars, and a flat ground. The player can move Spider-Man using the keyboard and use the mouse to shoot webs. When the web hits a point, Spider-Man moves toward that point, which feels like climbing or swinging with a web. This project is mainly for learning purposes and is not a full commercial game.

**What the Player Can Do**
Move Spider-Man forward, backward, left, and right using the keyboard
Shoot a web using the mouse
Move toward the web point like web swinging or climbing
See Spider-Man clearly because the camera follows him

**Game Environment**

The city has tall buildings that do not move
Buildings are white with black windows
The sky is light blue with small stars
The ground is flat and represents the city floor

**Spider-Man Character**
Spider-Man is made using simple shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders
He wears a red and blue costume
White eyes are added to make the face look better
The web always comes from Spider-Man’s hand

**Extra Features**
Spider-Man cannot walk through buildings
Movement looks smooth
The game runs well on CodeBlocks, Dev-C++, and Visual Studio

**Purpose of the Project**
The purpose of this project is to:
Learn OpenGL programming
Understand 3D objects and camera movement
Practice keyboard and mouse control
Build a small interactive game

**Future Improvements**
Add textures to buildings and Spider-Man
Make web swinging more realistic
Add enemies or missions
Add sound and music
Improve lighting and shadows
